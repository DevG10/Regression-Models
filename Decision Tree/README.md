"# Decision Tree Regression-Models" 

 In supervised machine learning, a Decision Tree is a popular algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each node. These splits create a tree-like structure, where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents an outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents the final predicted target value or class label.
