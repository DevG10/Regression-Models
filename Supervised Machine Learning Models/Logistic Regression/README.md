# Logistic Regression-Model

Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification in supervised machine learning. Despite its name, it's used for classification, not regression. It predicts the probability that a given input data point belongs to a certain class, which is then mapped to a discrete class label, typically 0 or 1 for binary classification tasks.
